## Welcome to this Amazon Forecast MLOps with Amazon SageMaker Immersion Day Lab

SageMaker Projects help organizations set up and standardize developer environments for data scientists and CI/CD systems for MLOps engineers. Projects also help organizations set up dependency management, code repository management, build reproducibility, and artifact sharing.

You can provision SageMaker Projects from the AWS Service Catalog using custom or SageMaker-provided templates. With SageMaker Projects, MLOps engineers and organization admins can define their own templates or use SageMaker-provided templates. The SageMaker-provided templates bootstrap the ML workflow with source version control, automated ML pipelines, and a set of code to quickly start iterating over ML use cases.

In this lab, we will re-use one of the MLOps Projects that are available through SageMaker Studio and make modifications on the pipeline to enable time series data training in Amazon Forecast. Later, we will show how we can use the modified template to create a new Portfolio and Product in AWS Service Catalog, that will allow us to re-utilize the new custom project across our Organization
